We are pleased to announce the release of PyUtilib 5.8.0. The
PyUtilib project supports the development of an ensemble of Python
packages that include a wide variety of utilities, including a
well-developed component architecture.

The following are highlights of the 5.8 release series:

- Removed use of pyutilib and pyutilib.component namespace packages
- Reworked optional dependency imports to speed up importing

Additional changes are listed in CHANGELOG.txt

PyUtilib can be installed from PyPI using pip or conda-forge using conda.

Enjoy!
