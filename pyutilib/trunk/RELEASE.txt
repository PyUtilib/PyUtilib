We are pleased to announce the release of !PyUtilib 5.0 (5.0.3478). The !PyUtilib project supports the development of an ensemble of Python packages that include a wide variety of utilities, including a well-developed component architecture.

The following are highlights of this release:

- Integrating many PyUtilib sub-packages into a single source tree
- Integrating the Coopr plugin framework in pyutilib.component.core
- pyutilib.th
  - Adding a forcedskip option, which can be used to add tests that
    are skipped due to external factors.
  - Extending baseline tests to allow comparison with YAML, XML and
    JSON files.
- pyutilib.pyro
  - Changes to support clearing the dispatcher queue
  - Allowing more control of blocking behavior when calling dispatcher
  - Adding randomization of the sleep interval in a pyro client,
    following failure to initially connect to a name server.
- pyutilib.misc
  - Allowing None tolerance when comparing YAML files.
  - Adding support for gzip and bz2 compressed files, which act as
    single file archives
  - Adding support to open readonly file objects (using the open()
    method) rather than only supporting file extractions to disk

Enjoy!
